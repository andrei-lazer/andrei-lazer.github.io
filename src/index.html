<p>
This is my website! I'm a UK-based student and soon-to-be quantitative
developer. Check out the about me section for more info, or the posts section
to see some of my projects. I prefer to be contacted via 
<a href="/email">email</a>, since I rarely check anything else.
</p>

<h2>warning</h2>

<p>
I can't promise that this website has been recently updated. It's a fun side project of mine, but I'm notoriously bad
at keeping on top of these kinds of things.
