<h2>warning</h2>

<p>
I can't promise that this website has been recently updated. It's a fun side project of mine, but I'm notoriously bad
at keeping on top of these kinds of things.

<h2>about</h2>

<p>
I'm a maths student at the University of
Oxford studying for the
<a href="https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/members/students/postgraduate-courses/msc-mmsc">MSc in MMSC</a>.
I'm interested in numerical analysis, parallel computing, HPC, and almost everything else which lets me do both
maths and computing.
