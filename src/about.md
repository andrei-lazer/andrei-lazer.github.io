I’m Andrei Lazer, a maths student at the University of Oxford studying for the [MSc in
MMSC](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/members/students/postgraduate-courses/msc-mmsc).

I’m interested in numerical analysis, parallel computing, HPC, and almost anything else that lets me do both maths and
computing.

Next year, I’ll be interning as a Quantitative Developer for [Qube Research & Technologies](https://www.qube-rt.com/),
where I’ll mostly be coding in Python. I previously interned at NVIDIA in the [automotive
department](https://developer.nvidia.com/drive), where I worked on [fuzz testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing)
their [cryptography library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_11).
