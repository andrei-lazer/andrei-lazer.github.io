Quick fun facts:
- I’m doing a master's in maths in the UK, focused on numerical analysis, random systems, and optimization.
- I can speak English, Romanian, French, Mandarin, and German (in sharply decreasing order).

Personally, I'm interested in almost all parts of computer science and maths, and enjoy being below
average at web development and bash scripting. I want to get into homelabbing and mechanical
keyboards when I have the disposable income to waste.

I've previously interned as a researcher in computational maths, as well as an embedded developer in
automotives. I'll be shifting into software development for trading when I finish my degree.
