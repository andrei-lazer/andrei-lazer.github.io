## about me

I'm Andrei Lazer, a maths student at the University of Oxford studying for the
[MSc in MMSC](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/members/students/postgraduate-courses/msc-mmsc).
I'm interested in numerical analysis, parallel computing, HPC, and almost
anything else that lets me do both maths and computing.

Next year, I'll be interning as a Quantitative Developer for [Qube Research &
Technologies](https://www.qube-rt.com/), where I'll mostly be coding in Python. I previously
interned at NVIDIA in the [automotive division](https://developer.nvidia.com/drive), where I
worked on [fuzz testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing) for their [cryptography
library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_11).
