This is my website! I'm a UK-based student and soon-to-be quantitative developer. Check out
[about](/about) for more info, [now](/now) for what I'm up to "now", or [posts](/posts) to see
some of my projects. I prefer to be contacted via [email](/email), since I rarely check anything
else.

This website has had <span id="visitorCount">an unknown number of</span> visitors, and is part
of 2 [webrings](/misc#webrings).

## warning

I can't promise that this website has been recently updated. It's a fun side project of mine, but I'm notoriously bad
at keeping on top of these kinds of things. Paradoxically, it is also always under development, so parts of it might be
broken.
