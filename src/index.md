## warning

I can't promise that this website has been recently updated. It's a fun side project of mine, but I'm notoriously bad
at keeping on top of these kinds of things.

## about

I'm a maths student at the University of
Oxford studying for the
[MSc in MMSC](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/members/students/postgraduate-courses/msc-mmsc). I'm interested in numerical analysis, parallel
computing, HPC, and almost everything else which lets me do both
maths and computing.
