This was my first (and possibly only) paper! This resulted from the
[StARIS](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/students/academic/staris/) internship at the University of St
Andrews. My only contributions are the majority of Section IV, where I used <span style="white-space:nowrap;">k-means</span> clustering,
pruning, and regression techniques to predict certain quantities of a turbulent flow. 

This was my first foray into computational maths research, and I am extremely thankful to my
supervisor [Dan Lucas](https://danl21.github.io/) for all of his support and mentorship. I would not
be where I am now without his help.
