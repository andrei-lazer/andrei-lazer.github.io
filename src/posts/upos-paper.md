This project, which then became a publication in *Physical Review Fluids* titled *Dynamically
relevant recurrent flows obtained via a nonlinear recurrence function from two-dimensional
turbulence*, was my first bit of research experience, and currently my only publication.

This resulted from the [StARIS](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/students/academic/staris/) internship
at the University of St Andrews. My only contributions are the majority of Section IV, where I used
<nobr>k-means</nobr> clustering, pruning, and regression techniques to
predict certain quantities of a turbulent flow.

[here](/assets/orbits_plots.png) for some (not as pretty) plots that I created.

This was my first foray into computational maths research, and I am extremely thankful to my
supervisor [Dan Lucas](https://danl21.github.io/) for all of his support and mentorship. I would not
be where I am now without his help.
