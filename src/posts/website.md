This website is currently my most maintained project. While I'm unlikely to ever pivot into web development,
front end development is very rewarding. There's nothing else with quite the same visual feedback
loop.

I started out using just HTML and CSS, but now I've recently switched over to using the static site
generator [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/). It's hosted on [Github
Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages), and uses a free student domain from
[namecheap](https://nc.me/).

Here are some resources I used for this project:
- [Jaydan Urwin's 11ty Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzM5lETc6Sg&list=PLtLXFsdHI8JTwScHvB924dY3PNwNJjjuW)
- [Github Pages Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages)
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)
- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) (only occasionally)

And some sites I either took inspiration from, or just thought were cool:
- [misterdizzy.neocities.org](https://misterdizzy.neocities.org/)
- [dimden.dev](https://dimden.dev/)
- [www.thestopbits.net](https://www.thestopbits.net/)
- [masonarmand.com](https://masonarmand.com/)
- [daliwali.neocities.org](https://daliwali.neocities.org/)
- [yazo.ink](https://yazo.ink/)
- [durdraw.org](https://durdraw.org/)
- [jasoncameron.dev](https://jasoncameron.dev/about)
