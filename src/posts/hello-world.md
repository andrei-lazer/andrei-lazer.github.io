I started this website to have a place to put anything I want, as well as challenge me to learn
something new. While I'm unlikely to ever pivot into web development, front end development is very
rewarding. There's nothing else with quite the same visual feedback loop.

I started out using just HTML and CSS, but now I've recently switched over to using the static site
generator [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/). It's hosted on [Github
Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages), and uses a free student domain from
[namecheap](https://nc.me/). The visitor counter on the home page uses the [abacus
API](https://v2.jasoncameron.dev/abacus/).

Here are some resources I used for this project:
- [Jaydan Urwin's 11ty Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzM5lETc6Sg&list=PLtLXFsdHI8JTwScHvB924dY3PNwNJjjuW)
- [Github Pages Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages)
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)

[Here](/links#personal-websites) are some websites I think are cool and have probably taken
inspiration from.
