I think learning a language is one of the hardest intellectual things you can do, but I also think
language learning is simple.

## what?
What I mean by this is that the actual process of learning a language doesn't have very many moving

language. While there are lots of different pedagogical approaches, the day-to-day experience of
learning a language is usually extremely repetitive and trivial to do.
