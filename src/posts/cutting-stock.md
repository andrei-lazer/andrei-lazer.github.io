This is a report I wrote for [B6.3 Integer
Programming](https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=6068) as part of my [MSc in
MMSC](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/members/students/postgraduate-courses/msc-mmsc). It's on the
binary cutting stock problem, a one-dimensional integer programming problem. I used an algorithm
called branch-and-price, and implemented it (quite hurriedly) in Python.

It is written in [typst](https://typst.app/) and compiled using their _very_ incomplete HTML
function, so there are quite a few rendering issues, but it should be mostly comprehensible. The
report is [here](./report.html), and the code is
[here](https://github.com/andrei-lazer/cutting-stock-bnp).
