This is my dissertation for my [BSc in Mathematics at the University of St
Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/mathematics/mathematics-bsc/), titled *Time-splitting
spectral methods for the Schrödinger equation in the semi-classical regime*.

I looked at a specific class of numerical integrators for the Schrödinger equation, proved some
convergence/stability results, and confirmed these results computationally.

I enjoyed this project so much that it convinced me to go
through with a master's. Shout out to my supervisor 
[Irene Kyza](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/mathematics-statistics/people/ika1/) for pushing me to create
something I'm proud of.
