This is my dissertation for my BSc in Mathematics at the University of St Andrews, titled 
*{{ name }}*.

I looked at a specific class of numerical integrators for the Schrödinger equation, proved some
convergence/stability results, and confirmed these results computationally.

through with a master's. Shout out to my supervisor [Irene Kyza](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/mathematics-statistics/people/ika1/)
for pushing me to create something I'm proud of.
