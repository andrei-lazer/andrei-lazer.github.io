## reading

I've been zooming through the [Mistborn Trilogy](https://www.librarything.com/work/9190082/t/The-Mistborn-Trilogy)
by Brandon Sanderson. It's quickly become one of my favourite fantasy series.

## uni

I did a research project on the [cutting stock
problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting_stock_problem) for my [Integer
Programming](https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=6068) class, and I've posted it
[here](/posts/cutting-stock/).

This term I'm doing a few more projects.
- Another project similar to the integer programming one, this time on [deep Q-learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning#Function_approximation)
  as part of an [Optimal Control module](https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=6131).
- Two group projects: one on stochastic modelling of infectious diseases, and one on
  [PINNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics-informed_neural_networks).

## languages

I've been on a bit of a language learning hiatus since I started my master's. From January 2025 to
July 2025, I averaged >2hrs of active (Mandarin) Chinese immersion + 7 new Anki cards per day, and I
made a loooot of progress. However, with studying and interview prep taking up a lot of
time, I've put that on the back burner.
