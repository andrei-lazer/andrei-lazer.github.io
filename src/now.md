## reading

Currently reading [Butcher's
Crossing](https://www.librarything.com/work/1032856/t/Butchers-Crossing) by John Williams.
[Stoner](https://www.librarything.com/work/169174/300637089), by the same author, is probably my
favourite book of all time, so I've finally come around to reading another one of his books.

I'm also very slowly trying to get through [The Count of Monte
Cristo](https://www.librarything.com/work/3728592/covers/301702847) in French, which is proving to
be quite difficult.

## uni

I've got my first round of exams for my master's degree in 10 days. My modules are titled
[Numerical Linear Algebra](https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=6110), [Numerical
Solutions to PDEs](https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=6069), and [Applied
PDEs](https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=6072). I'm also doing a research project on
the [cutting stock problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting_stock_problem) for my [Integer
Programming](https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=6068) class, which I will post on
here if it ends up being any good.

The jump from my undergrad is very significant, but I'm quite enjoying it. I still can't wait to
never study for an exam again though.
