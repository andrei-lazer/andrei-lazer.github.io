This is my "[now page](https://nownownow.com/about)". Last updated 31 January 2026.

## reading

I'm about halfway through the first book of [The Mistborn Trilogy](https://www.librarything.com/work/9190082/t/The-Mistborn-Trilogy)
by Brandon Sanderson, and really enjoying it. It's a great way to relax after studying.

## uni

I did a research project on the [cutting stock
problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting_stock_problem) for my [Integer
Programming](https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=6068) class, and I've posted it
[here](/posts/cutting-stock/).

This term I'm studying 
[Continuous Optimisation](https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=6141), 
[Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos](https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=6089), 
[Further Partial Differential Equations](https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=6288), and 
[Further Mathematical Methods](https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=6289).

I'm also doing a few more projects.
- Another project similar to the integer programming one, this time on reinforcement learning for
  finance as part of an [Optimal Control module](https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=6131).
- Two group projects: one on stochastic modelling of infectious diseases, and one on
  [PINNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics-informed_neural_networks).

## languages

I've been on a bit of a language learning hiatus since I started my master's. From January 2025 to
July 2025, I averaged >2hrs of active (Mandarin) Chinese immersion + 7 new Anki cards per day, and I
made a loooot of progress. However, with studying and interview prep taking up a lot of
time, I've put that on the back burner.
