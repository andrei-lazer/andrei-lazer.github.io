## reading

I've just finished [Butcher's
Crossing](https://www.librarything.com/work/1032856/t/Butchers-Crossing), and I unsurprisingly
really enjoyed it. John Williams has a talent for writing the bleakest stories I've ever read, and
they resonate with me for some reason.

I've given up on [The Count of Monte Cristo](https://www.librarything.com/work/3728592/covers/301702847),
since reading dense 19th century French fiction isn't particularly relaxing during my master's.
Maybe I'll pick it up at some other point.

I started reading [Revenge](https://www.librarything.com/work/12986447/book/304993934) by Yoko Ogawa
yesterday. I quite liked [The Housekeeper and the Professor](https://www.librarything.com/work/5263983/t/The-Housekeeper-and-the-Professor)
by the same author, and this book is proving to be similarly heartwrenching.

## uni

I just had my first exams for my master's! They were extremely tough. I expected the jump from my
undergrad to be significant, but it still took me by surprise. I have a lot to learn for the
next set of exams.

Last term's modules were titled [Numerical Linear
Algebra](https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=6110), [Numerical Solutions to
PDEs](https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=6069), and [Applied
PDEs](https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=6072). I'm also doing a research project on
the [cutting stock problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting_stock_problem) for my [Integer
Programming](https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=6068) class, which I will post on
here if it ends up being any good.

This term I'm doing 
[Continuous Optimisation](https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=6141), 
[Nonlinear Dynamics, Bifurcations and Chaos](https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=6089), 
[Further Partial Differential Equations](https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=6288), and 
[Further Mathematical Methods](https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=6289). I'm also
doing some projects that haven't been finalised yet.
