## reading

I've started reading [The Mistborn Trilogy](https://www.librarything.com/work/9190082/t/The-Mistborn-Trilogy)
by Brandon Sanderson. I like reading easy fantasy when uni/work picks up, so this is my next series
of choice.

## uni

I did a research project on the [cutting stock
problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting_stock_problem) for my [Integer
Programming](https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=6068) class, and I've posted it
[here](/posts/cutting-stock/report.html).


I recently had my first exams for my master's! They were extremely tough. I expected the jump from my
undergrad to be significant, but it still took me by surprise. I have a lot to learn for the
next set of exams.

Last term's modules were titled [Numerical Linear
Algebra](https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=6110), [Numerical Solutions to
PDEs](https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=6069), and [Applied
PDEs](https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=6072). 

This term I'm studying 
[Continuous Optimisation](https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=6141), 
[Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos](https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=6089), 
[Further Partial Differential Equations](https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=6288), and 
[Further Mathematical Methods](https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=6289).

I'm also doing a few more projects.
- Another project similar to the integer programming one, this time (probably) on
[Optimal Control](https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=6131).
- Two group projects that are yet to be finalised, but hopefully on stochastic modelling of
  infectious diseases, and [PINNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics-informed_neural_networks).
