## academic

### [Time-splitting spectral methods for the Schrödinger equation in the semi-classical regime](/assets/docs/sta-diss.pdf)

Dissertation for my BSc in Mathematics at the University of St Andrews. Looked at a specific type of numerical
integrators for the Schrödinger equation, proved some convergence/stability results, and confirmed these results
computationally.

Click on the link and take a look at the graphs! I enjoyed this project so much that it convinced me to go
through with a master's. Shout out to my supervisor [Irene Kyza](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/mathematics-statistics/people/ika1/)
for pushing me to create something I'm proud of.

### [Dynamically relevant recurrent flows obtained via a nonlinear recurrence function from two-dimensional turbulence](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevFluids.9.124401)

Publication resulting from the [StARIS](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/students/academic/staris/)
internship at the University of St Andrews. See Section IV for my main contributions. 
I used data analysis techniques to predict certain quantities of a turbulent flow using its periodic orbits.
This was my first foray into computational maths research, and I'm very thankful to my supervisor 
[Dan Lucas](https://danl21.github.io/) for all of his support.

## fun


### [Order Book](https://github.com/andrei-lazer/order-book)

Price-time priority order book written in C++. Implemented Add, Cancel and Match events for Good-Till-Cancel
orders. Unit testing is done with Google test.

This is the project which best represents my C++ skills.


### [Pong for the 3DS](https://github.com/andrei-lazer/pong-3ds)

Important: This code does not represent my current abilities, but I thought I would include this because it
was quite fun to do.

It's just a very basic and quite buggy Pong clone on the 3DS. I learned a lot about C++ and it motivated me to work
on better projects.
