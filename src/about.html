<h2>about me</h2>

<p>
  I'm Andrei Lazer, a maths student at the University of Oxford studying for the
  <a href="https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/members/students/postgraduate-courses/msc-mmsc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    MSc in MMSC</a>.
  I'm interested in numerical analysis, parallel computing, HPC, and almost
  anything else that lets me do both maths and computing.
</p>

<p>
Next year, I'll be interning as a Quantitative Developer for <a href="https://www.qube-rt.com/"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Qube Research & Technologies</a>, where I'll mostly be coding
in Python. I previously interned at NVIDIA in the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/drive"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"> automotive department</a>, where I worked on <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> fuzz testing</a> for
their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_11" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> cryptography
library</a>.
